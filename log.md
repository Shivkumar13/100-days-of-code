# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 26, 2021 (Hello World Web App)

**Today's Progress**: Created a small REST "Hello World" Web App

**Thoughts:** It looked challenging at the start but really it was a great learning when I digged into it, I got to know how we can leverage the rich golang libraries, I came to know more about the "net/http" package in this exercise.

**Link to work:** [Hello World Web App] https://github.com/Shivkumar13/GoREST/blob/main/main.go

### Day 1: April 27, 2021 (Added Contact Page to the simple web app)

**Today's Progress**: Added Contact Page to the simple web app, made use of net/http package.

****Thoughts:** I was not sure about the ResponseWriter usage much, but after some research was able to get the rendered page working in the web app.

### Day 2: April 28, 2021 (Added 404 Page & implemented httprouter)

**Today's Progress**: Added 404 Page & implemented httprouter, made use oof third party library to implement router

****Thoughts:** Struggled with the httprouter (3rd party library), will explore more on it.

### Day 3: April 29, 2021 (Added FAQ Page and used github.com/gorilla/mux library")

**Today's Progress**: Added FAQ Page and used github.com/gorilla/mux library". 

****Thoughts:** Explored more on the MUX library, initially evrything I implemented was with the net/http library but today I changed code to use more of MUX library.

### Day 4: April 30, 2021 (Started a New Web App REST API in Go)

**Today's Progress**: Created a brand new Books Web application in Go, used various libraries like log, encoding/json. 

****Thoughts:** Explored Slice concept in Go, I was not known with its usage at start. Also I am not 100% confident on all the concepts used today so I need to go through each and every library's concept/methods/function in depth to see it's other possible usages.


### Day 5: May 1, 2021 (Added Create, Update, Delete Handlers)

**Today's Progress**: Added Create, Update, Delete Handlers to the REST API. Made use of Math/rand and strconv.

****Thoughts:** Struggled a bit today with the new libraries. Added Create, Update, Delete Handlers to the REST API. Made use of Math/rand and strconv which are pretty new for me.

### Day 6: May 2, 2021 (Learned about For statement in depth)

**Today's Progress**: Learned about For statement in depth, explored For usage.

****Thoughts:** I needed to get clarifications on the FOR so took time and learned that. Now pretty much confident on the For, nested-for, and other types os usage for "FOR clause"

### Day 7: May 3, 2021 (Learned about OOP concepts in Golang)

**Today's Progress**: Got an idea about OOP in golang, as of now tried a small program to implement the OOP in Golang with the usage of structs.

****Thoughts:** Initially I was not recalling the concepts of OOP which I learned in C++, but there are bit differences in the OOP of Golang and C++. So I will be exploring more on these things.

### Day 8: May 4, 2021 (Learned about Arrays, Slices, Stacks)

**Today's Progress**: Have learned about the Arrays, Slices and basic Stack operations. This was really a fun while learning and I just liked it.

****Thoughts:** I need to learn more operations on these things, as for some concepts of Stack I was not really sure how to deal with, I will explore more on these concepts.

### Day 9: May 5, 2021 (Tried various examples for yesterdays learning)

**Today's Progress**: Tried different type of examples for yesterday's learning, refered to gobyexample.com

****Thoughts:** Not soo much difficult to learn as basic concepts of Arrays and Slices were good for me.

### Day 10: May 6, 2021 (Learned about Maps in Golang)

**Today's Progress**: Learned about MAps in Golang, how it is different from other data types. Key-value based datatype

****Thoughts:** Was confused with the syntax of it at start, but with practice got to know certain things.

### Day 11: May 8, 2021 (Was remaining with the operations on Slices, learned that)

**Today's Progress**: Was remaining with the operations on Slices, learned that and did various operations like appending the slice.

****Thoughts:** Slice is really Easy to learn, got much confidence on Arrays and Slices in Go.
