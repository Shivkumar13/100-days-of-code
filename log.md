# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 26, 2021 (Hello World Web App)

**Today's Progress**: Created a small REST "Hello World" Web App

**Thoughts:** It looked challenging at the start but really it was a great learning when I digged into it, I got to know how we can leverage the rich golang libraries, I came to know more about the "net/http" package in this exercise.
