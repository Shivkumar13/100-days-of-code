# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Shivkumar]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [April 26th , Monday, 2021].

## Log

### R1D0 
Started a REST Hello World Web App, using Golang.

### R1D1
Added a contact page and used If-Else to render the pages on the basis of requests. Also made use of ResponseWriter from net/http package. 

### R1D2
Made use of httprouter library, and implemented a router, also added a 404 page in the application, hence if someone hits wrong Path 404 page will get displayed.

### R1D3
Added FAQ Page and used github.com/gorilla/mux library. Explored more on the MUX library, initially evrything I implemented was with the net/http library but today I changed code to use more of MUX library.

### R1D4
Created a brand new Books App REST API in Go. Used encoding/json, log, various libraries. Also Added getBooks(), getBook() functions as of now. Will be adding for create update and delete in coming days.

### R1D5
Added Create, Update, Delete Handlers to the REST API. Made use of Math/rand and strconv. I will be exploring on these topics when I will start to learn these individual libraries.

### R1D6
Learned about For statement in depth, explored For usage.

### R1D7
Learned about OOP concepts in Golang.

### R1D8 
Learned about Arrays, Slices, Stacks.  

### R1D9 
Tried different type of examples for yesterday's learning, refered to gobyexample.com

### R1D10
Learned about Maps in Golang. A key-value based data type, need to explore more from it's usage perspective.

### R1D11
Was remaining with the operations on Slices, learned that and did various operations like appending the slice.

### R1D12
Solved some more operations on slices, also solved some Ninja level tasks from a udemy course.

### R1D13
Did various operations on Maps, adding to a Map, deleting elements  from a Map


### R1D14
Learned basics of structs, will be doing more operations 

### R1D15
Learned basics of embedded structs, also did some basic operations on it. 

### R1D16
Learned about syntax of Func, tried basic and func with return type and arguments also.

### R1D17
Functions, explored func with multiple return type

### R1D18
Learned about variadic function, how can we use arbitrary number of parameters to pass to a function.

### R1D19
Did Ninja exercises on the Variadic Functions in Go, practised the exercises from course outlines.

### R1D20
Housekeeping exercises in the Golang, using the Ease of programming approach to make code simpler and easy to read.

### R1D21
Arrays usages, anonymous structs exercises from the Todd's course.

### R1D22
No particular new topic, but learned more on the structs.

### R1D23
Declared slixe and have  stored that slice in a variable first. Then passed in that variable to the function. So here we opened that slice in some way.
